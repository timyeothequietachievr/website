                Being an introvert in a world that desires the extrovert ideal is hard. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Like you, I struggled to manage my introversion. <br />For years, I read self-help books on public speaking. I modeled social butterflies at networking events. I watched in awe as company leaders delivered speeches effortlessly.
              </p>
              <h3>I thought: if I tried hard enough I could be like them.</h3>
              <p>
              Mostly, it didn't work. When it did work, I was exhausted pretending to be someone else. It always felt unnatural.<br />Maybe there was something wrong with me. Maybe I wasn't good enough. 
              </p>
              <h3>Yet, the lion inside me _just_ would not shut up.</h3>
              <p>
                There had to be a better way.<br />I did not realise it at the time. But I took the best of what I learned. I stopped pretending and started practicing, making those techniques my own.<br />Which brings us to The Quiet Achiever. 
              </p>
              <h3>The Quiet Achiever's mission is to help introverts have impact and influence without pretending to be extroverts.</h3>
              <p>
              Maybe you are tired of keeping quiet in meetings even though you have something to say.<br />Perhaps you wish you were better at networking and didn't find it awkward and embarrassing.<br />Or maybe you just wish you were more visible in your organisation because you know how have something value to say; if only people heard you.<br />There is a better way; and you don't have to do it alone; cos' we're here.
