          Being an introvert in a world that desires the extrovert ideal is hard.<br></br><br></br>
          For years, I struggled to manage my own introversion. I loved my craft. I had high ambitions. I wanted to excel. So I voraciously read self-help books on leadership. I watched every great TED Talk. I modelled social butterflies at networking events. I watched in awe as company leaders delivered speeches effortlessly.<br></br><br></br>
          <strong>I thought:</strong> if I tried hard enough, I could be just like them.<br></br><br></br>
          <strong>And it worked!</strong> But I was exhausted pretending to be someone else. It always felt unnatural. It felt like I was wearing a mask; and with each passing day, that mask grew heavier and heavier, until I could not put it on anymore.<br></br><br></br>
          <strong>I thought:</strong> maybe there was something wrong with me. Maybe I wasn't good enough. But there was a voice inside of me that refused to give up. There had to be a better way.<br></br><br></br>
          So I stopped pretending. I took the best of what I learned and started practising. I kept what worked and made those skills my own. Today, I am no longer faking it. I am no longer pretending to be someone else. I no longer wear an extrovert mask.<br></br><br></br>
          It's a different path to success, but it is a path I walk very comfortably in my own skin.<br></br><br></br>
          My coaching draws upon my decades of experience working in tech startups surrounded by people with strong opinions and loud voices. I've made plenty of mistakes along the way; I will help you avoid them.<br></br><br></br>
          Your life is too short to be living someone else's version of success. Show up as the best version of yourself, and I can coach you on how to do it.<br></br><br></br>

        I'm your coach. Over live video calls, we talk through the challenges you are facing and where you want help right now.<br></br><br></br>
        Coaching requires chemistry. I can help many people, but I can't help everyone. So we start with a <a href="#pricing" className="text-indigo-600">free discovery call</a> to see if you & I are a good fit.<br></br><br></br>
        Coaching helps you level up faster. How fast depends on you.<br></br><br></br>
        The quiet achievers I can help achieve their goals in days and weeks with my assistance—goals which would normally take them months or years to accomplish on their own.<br></br><br></br>

        <ul role="list">
          <li><strong>New quiet leader:</strong> You are quiet by nature. You've been made a leader. You're feeling strong imposter syndrome. Every other leader around you is loud and has strong opinions. Your team is looking to you for answers, but you're unsure of what you are doing</li>
          <li><strong>Self promotion:</strong> You do great work and have huge successes but wish you could be more visible and talk about your wins without feeling like you're bragging</li>
          <li><strong>Talk like a leader:</strong> You have the technical skills and the great ideas but you're not confident in convincing others and public speaking</li>
          <li><strong>Friction with strong opinions:</strong> They talk louder, got strong points of view and you don't know how to say no or handle their difficult conversations</li>
          <li><strong>Thought leader:</strong> A major presentation/public talk/event/podcast is coming; you're nervous about speaking in front of a big group and being put on the spot</li>
          <li><strong>Interview preparation and rehearsal:</strong> You got the skills, you got the experience for the job you really want but somehow you never get picked</li>
          <li><strong>Get promoted:</strong> You want to be promoted to a leadership role but your boss says "you are not ready", you feel stuck and you don't know what to do to get there</li>
          <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Meet new people, grow your network, make small talk, introduce yourself with confidence without the icky feeling</li>

          <li><strong>Limiting beliefs and norms</strong> In your bubble, your way has been the only way you know. We sometimes lie to ourselves too to have an easy out. Where I see you do this, I'll point it out and we'll talk about it</li>
          <li><strong>Tough love</strong> You must know I'm pretty direct, low bs and I will tell you the things you need to hear to level up. I will do it with kindness and good humour</li>
